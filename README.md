# Periodic Table Database

This project is a database-driven application that stores information about elements in the periodic table. It allows users to query elements based on their atomic number, symbol, or name. The database contains details such as atomic mass, melting point, boiling point, and type (metal, non-metal, metalloid).

The project includes a PostgreSQL database and a Bash script for querying element data.
